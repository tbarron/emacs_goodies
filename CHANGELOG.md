## 1.0.0 ...

 * Make diary (\M-j, \C-xj) and mydoc (\C-xm) work as desired.
 * Assign version 1.0.0 with file version.el and load it at startup (\M-v).
 * Make emacs_goodies part of the community of projects in ~/prj/github
 * This repository has a long history and we're just adding CHANGELOG now.
   Oh, well.
